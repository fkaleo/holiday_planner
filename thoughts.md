1. Thinking of what end goal for the user would be, what the tool would the user would use during his/her trip would look like: probably a calendar like view with destinations, dates, and possibly a map view
   This could/should be editable allowing for manual planning. Also suggestions made by the app could be shown in that view.
   Somehow possible destinations should be shown so that the user can easily select one. Additional information on those destinations should be shown, weather, travel time, etc.

2. Drawing drafts of the app interface and functionality so that I can then extract the objects, their relationships and possible actions on them.

3. Listing objects, the attributes, their relationships and possible actions on them.

4. Scaffolding project (git, python version, poetry, django, etc.)

5. Implementing various API routes with their models, views and serializers

6. Added Docker integration and running with docker compose using PostgreSQL
